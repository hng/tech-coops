## What are worker-owned tech cooperatives?

A very general definition:
> Worker-owned cooperatives are business enterprises that are owned and governed by their employees. All worker cooperatives have two common characteristics: 1) member-owners invest in and own the business together, and share the enterpriseâ€™s profits, and 2) decision-making is democratic, with each member having one vote.

â€“ [community-wealth.org](http://community-wealth.org/content/worker-cooperatives)

Tech cooperatives are worker-owned cooperatives that operate in the information technology industry. This list focuses on tech coops that are providing software development and consulting services.

Tech cooperatives could be a solution if you feel alienated by big software corporations and startup culture or you feel alone and in search of solidarity as a freelancer.
